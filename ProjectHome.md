This library makes creating valid RSS 2.0 feeds easy and fast by providing an easy structure of .net objects.  There is nothing really special about it except for the fact that you will stop having to figure out what all the RSS 2.0 rules and just publish  your feed. It builds upon the principle of code reuse so that you only have to solve the problem once. This does not need to have asp.net to work. You can output to a string using the `.ToString()` method on any object.
